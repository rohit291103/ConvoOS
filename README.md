# ConvoOS

üß† **ConvoOS** is a Chrome extension that captures user prompts from ChatGPT and other AI chat platforms, enabling seamless context syncing and agentic execution across multiple AI models and applications.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

ConvoOS bridges the gap between AI chatbots by:

- Capturing and storing prompts you type on ChatGPT (and other supported AI platforms)
- Syncing conversation context across different AI agents and services
- Enabling agentic execution of commands on third-party platforms (e.g., GitHub) via MCP-based APIs

This allows users to continue workflows seamlessly across multiple AI environments without losing context.

## üì¶ Features (Sprint 1 MVP)

- Chrome extension popup UI built with React
- Captures ChatGPT prompt text via content scripts
- Stores last prompt locally using Chrome Storage API
- Visual indicator showing ConvoOS is active
- Manual sync button (no backend integration yet)
